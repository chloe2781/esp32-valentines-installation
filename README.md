## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE or compatible ESP32 development environment
- TFT_eSPI library for the ESP32 TTGO T-display

## Setup Instructions
1. Assemble the Hardware: Solder the battery to the ESP32 module.
2. Prepare Your Development Environment: Ensure the Arduino IDE is installed with support for the ESP32. Install the TFT_eSPI library through the Library Manager.
3. Programming the ESP32:
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Open the provided sketch in the Arduino IDE.
- Update the port/device settings and any other configurations specific to your environment.
- Upload the 'valentines_installation.ino' sketch to your ESP32 TTGO T-display.
4. Place the module inside the paper envelope, leaving the screen visible.
5. Hang the module up with a thread connected to a popsicle stick
  
## Usage
Once programmed and plugged into battery, the ESP32 display will visualize little red hearts flying from the bottom to the top of the screen, accompanied by the lines of a poem.
